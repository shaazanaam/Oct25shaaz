npm is for:
Installing packages: npm install prisma
Running scripts defined in package.json: npm run dev, npm start
Managing dependencies
npx is for:
Executing packages directly without installing them globally
Running CLI tools that come with packages
Executing binaries from locally installed packages
Why npx prisma generate instead of npm prisma generate:
prisma is a CLI tool - When you install the prisma package, it comes with a command-line interface (CLI) tool

Local execution - npx looks for the prisma binary in your .bin folder (since you have prisma installed as a devDependency)

Direct command execution - npx directly executes the Prisma CLI, while npm would look for a script named "prisma" in your package.json
npx prisma generate
# ↓
# npx finds: node_modules/.bin/prisma
# ↓  
# Executes: node_modules/.bin/prisma generate



Here is the alternative approach and then the npm script   will have to be added

{
  "scripts": {
    "db:generate": "prisma generate"
  }
}

 then run :npm run db:generate

 2. install Prisma globally( not recommended)

            npm install -g prisma 
            prisma generate 

             but the npx is the preferred approach because it 
                  uses the exact version in the project 
                  Doesnt require the global isntallation 
                  works consistently across different environments
                  is the standard way recommended in the Prisma documentaiton 

            so the npx prisma generate is essentially sayin execute the prisma CLI tool installed in this project dependencies and then run the generate command... npx  looks for the prisma binary in your .bin folder since we have installed the prisma as the devDependency
            npc directly executes the Prisma CLI wile the npm  would be looking for a script named prisma in the package,json
