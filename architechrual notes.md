Core services and the Execution layer will be  Provided by the NestJS Back end

The stack so far 
NestJS (Typescript )<--- core API and orchestration 
Postgres <--- Entity storage , tenants , users, flows
Redis <-- Sessions and conversation memory
Prisma <---- ORM for the database 

  Summary of the architectural notes 
  Multitenant AI Platform 
  Langraph  Work flow execution 
  KS integration ( Elastic search )
  Ticketing intgeration (Zammad)
  Conversation management 


So the backend will be gluing together the things like the DB -> Redis and the AI workflows and also any other external ticketing system like the Zammad . In the plain terms the Nest JS is going to be the brain..
 this will be folowing combination of the facitlies and then will be  the following qualities : 
 durable state API layer hot memory


 PostgreSQL  

 the folloiwing structured data will be persisted here  for example :

 1. tenants 
       org_id , billing iter , config, etc.. 
        we would be needing tenant isolation in every layer and then  eahc tenant will be  having their data users workflows and then integration dont mix.
         this plaform will be the smart support automation platform where organization can 
         1. create and configure AI workflows ( LangGraph) these flows define how the  AI responds searches the knowledge or escalates the tickets
          Example " If user asks a question -> search the KB -> if no answer -> create the Zammad ticker and notify on Slack
         2, Integrate their own toolds using their 
             KB ( elastisearch )   ticketing (Zammad) chat channels (Slack /MS teams ) etc

         3,  Use agent Interfaces ( Chat UIs)
             Web chat for users dashboards for the agents
         4, Track everything 
             Metrics , logs ticket status and workflow performance per tenant
              So you are basically going to be creating the brains and the plumbing for the conversational automation that any org can plug into


          Simplification of each layer 

          1. Front End layer - What the users see 

           UIs for  building the flows configuring triggers and the chatting 
           . Flow Authoring UI  -- where  admins visually design workflows (drag and drop like "if this then what")

           event config UI -- where the admin defines when a flow runs ( ex on a ticket update )
           
           Agent clients ------ chat  interfaces for the 
                                end Users ( web chat widget)      
                                support staff ( internal dash board )
                                 External messengers ( slack , teams)

                                  in shor this is where the humans are going to interacting with  design
