the docker compose file  will add and run the PostgreSQL inside the Docker or you 
So 

      we add a file to the project root folder 
      docker will  pull and run the post gres project inside  a container
      Prisma will then connect to that container using you .env DATABSE_URL

      with the docker its like one file (docker-compose.yml) + one command (docker compose up -d) 
      --it spins up a clean PostgreSQL server that  runs only inside a container
      When you stop or delete it , you system stays clean and no left over services
      Her is what the folder will be looking like 

      my-backend-app/
│
├── app.js
├── package.json
├── .env
├── prisma/
├── src/
└── docker-compose.yml  



this comman tells Docker to 
      1. Download the official PostgreSQL 16 from the docker hub 
      2. Run it locally in a light weight container
      3. expose it on port 5432 ( so the back end will be able to talk to it )
      5. Keep the data saved on the system (via the pgdata volume)


After it runs you can then check  the status with the following 

docker ps

 you should be able to see something like the containder ID the  name and the command and the port that the back end will be using to communicate

 now the backend can be able to reach the data base  using the Database_url ="postgresql://.........

 Thats all which the Prisma will then be connecting with the  database
 Prisma will be connecting via the .env and then the Database_url variable with the data base and this


  In terms of the OOP this is  what the docker does


In OOP terms --- new DatbaseServer()  - creates an instance of the DB class 
                  the class definition = PostgreSQL image 
                  the object fields = database name and user and password




In the docker analogy ------------------- 
      docker compose up -d  ----> creates a running  instance of a PostgreSQL server 
      the instance = docker container
      the environment variables in the  docker-compose-yml


      So in a nutshell when we are running the docker compose up -d we are actually instantiating the postgresql object form the postgresql class 

      you can stop start destroy that instance just like you would be manageing an object's lifecycle and you host remains untouched
